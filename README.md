## Repository for Volatility Prediction in my UCL Dissertation

Welcome to the repository dedicated to showcasing the code and data related to volatility prediction, a fundamental aspect of my master's degree dissertation at UCL.

In this repository, you'll find two distinct versions of the code files I've developed:

Version 1: Concise Code
The first version (Version 1) includes the code I've written for volatility prediction. This version is kept simple and compact, focusing solely on the code itself without displaying the results. It's designed to provide a quick overview of the implementation details without taking up much space.

Version 2: Comprehensive Code and Results
For a more comprehensive understanding, I've included the second version (Version 2) of the code files. This version not only contains the complete codebase for volatility prediction but also showcases the corresponding results. Due to its inclusive nature, the file size of Version 2 is larger.

Feel free to explore both versions to grasp the evolution of the project from concise code to a more complete implementation with visible outcomes.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find the contents insightful and valuable for your understanding of volatility prediction. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out!
