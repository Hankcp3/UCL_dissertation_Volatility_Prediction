# UCL_dissertation_Volatility_Prediction
This repository is used to display the code and data for volatility prediction in my master degree's dissertation.
Here I uploaded two versions of code files.
Version 1 contains only code without result, simple and small size.
Version 2 contains code with result, complete but large size.
